Configuring TS Compiler
Run command: tsc --init, this creates tsconfig.json file with default settings.

Initially it will be targeted to ES2016 i.e. ES5, as it is the old standard implemented in all the browsers.
Sepending on where we want to deploy the application we can use a higher target and this often results in shorter and less concise code.

We can remove the value i.e. ES2016 and press "ctrl+space" to see all valid values.

rootDir: it specifies the directory which contains source files.

Under "Emit" there will be a key "outDir", this will contain the directory which will contain all our JS files.
"removeComments": The TS compiler will remove comments in our TS code so generated JS code is gonna be shorter.
"noEmitOnError": By default, TS compiler will generate the code even though TS code have an error. With this set to true, TS Compiler will not generate JS code.

If we run command: tsc, it will compile all TS files in the project.
