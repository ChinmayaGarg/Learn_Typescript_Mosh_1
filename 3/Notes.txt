The TS compiler generated var keyword instead of the let keyword, by default TS use older version of JS called ES5.
ES is a standard or specification, while JS is an implementation of the specification.
ES5 have been around for very long time and all the features of ES5 have been implemented for very long time.
We can configure TS compiler to target newer JS version.
