Fundamentals:
The any type
Arrays
Tuples
Enums
Functions
Objects

JS has built in types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, object.
TS extends it by adding: any, unknown, never, enum, tuple

In TS we don't have to always annotate our variables because TS compiler can infer or detect the type of our variables based on their values.
Eg: let sales: number = 123_456_789; or let sales = 123_456_789;

If a variable is not declared and also not type-safed then TS assumes it is of type any.
