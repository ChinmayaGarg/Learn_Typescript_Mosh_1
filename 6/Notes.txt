Debugging TS Applications

In tsconfig.json, Under Emit section we enable "sourceMap" feature.
Source map is a file that specifies how each line of our TS code maps to the generated JS code.

Compiling again by "tsc" command, a new file "index.js.map" gets created. This is hard to understand. It is for debuggers/machines.

To debug code in vsCode, we go to Run and Debug in left panel, then click "create launch.json" file. Then choose the environment as "Node.js".
It will create a new file launch.json in the project with some pre-defined configurations.
